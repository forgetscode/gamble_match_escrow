in rust
  escrow contract
    -> init contract
        : takes in the account for fees to be deposited to
        : the token program for wrapped solana (so that we can create program derived accounts for
           new user's joining the game)
        : the minimum amount of SOL needed to join the game
    -> add user to match
        : takes in user public key
        : takes in user bid amount
        . checks that bid amount > minimum bid amount
        . creates program derived account using native mint program ID & user public key for wrapped solana
        . transfers the funds from the user's account into the native mint PDA account
    -> game is completed
        : takes in a winning user's public key
        : takes in all users in the match's public keys
        . if there is no winning user, return funds from each PDA derived from their public key's back to each user
           minus the fee for playing the game
        . if there is a winner, transfer funds to the winning player's account from all PDAs
